# Cuerpo Coffee

English-language coffee publication. Teaches beginners to make good coffee at home.
Selling a paid digital guide from month 5.

## Owner
Not a developer. Can run given commands; will not debug code. Explain new concepts briefly.

## Stack
Astro (static) · Markdown content collections · plain CSS with tokens · Keystatic at /keystatic ·
Cloudflare Pages · Kit (email) · Lemon Squeezy (payments, phase 4)

## Hard rules
- Static output only. No server, no database.
- No client-side JS unless a feature truly requires it. JS budget: 20 KB per article page.
- No Tailwind. All design values come from src/styles/tokens.css.
- No new dependencies without stating the cost and the alternative.
- Never commit secrets. Environment variables live in Cloudflare Pages settings.
- Out of scope: comments, accounts, search, dark mode, SSR, React/Vue/Svelte.

## Design
Palette: --ink --espresso --muted --crema --paper --copper. Six colors, no more.
Type: Fraunces (display), Inter (body). Self-hosted woff2. Two faces, three weights, total.
No shadows, no gradients, radius ≤ 2px, measure capped at 68ch.
The aesthetic is restraint. When in doubt, remove something.

## Before you start
Read docs/TECHNICAL-PLAN.md. It is the spec. Phase 3 is a code freeze — during it,
design ideas go to docs/BACKLOG.md rather than into the codebase.

## CLAUDE.md needs to be kept up to date

Every time you execute some part of the project, you must register your advances in this document, so new sessions can restore that point. You also have to create the docs you need under `docs/` dir.
